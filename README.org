* org-mac-protocol manual

A suite of scripts that allow the user to store org links from other
applications without switching focus to Emacs.

The following applications are currently supported:

+ Firefox
+ Chrome
+ Safari
+ Preview
+ Skim
+ AddressBook
+ BibDesk
+ Finder
+ Keynote
+ Mail
+ Numbers
+ Pages
+ Skim
+ Terminal
+ iTunes

There also exists a generic application handler that may or may not
work for applications without explicit support.

*NOTE*: Support for some of these applications may be buggy. I don't
have or use many of these apps but I felt like I should include all
the apps that the repo this was forked from supported, as examples of
how to add new handlers and to make it easier for others to patch it
themselves.

** Requirements

Tested on macOS 10.13 with org version 9.4.4.

** Installation and configuration

*** Emacs
      
- Put =org-mac-protocol.el= on your Emacs load-path

- ~(require 'org-mac-protocol)~

  or
     
  =M-x customize-variable <RET> org-modules <RET>=

  and add =org-mac-protocol= to =External packages=

- ~(server-start)~

- If you use Preview as the default app for opening PDFs, also do
  this to allow opening to individual pages:

  ~(setf (alist-get "\\.pdf\\'" org-file-apps nil nil #'equal) #'org-mac-preview-open)~

*** Find your preferred emacsclient
    
The makefile defines =EMACSCLIENT_SEARCH_PATH= and uses
=findEmacsClient.sh= to locate an emacsclient. If it does not find
your preferred emacsclient, you can edit the makefile or invoke make
as =EMACSCLIENT=/path/to/emacsclient make ...=

*** Applescripts and Automator Workflows

In short, to install the scripts: =make all=. Then, if desired, to
install the Automator workflows: =make services install-services=.

- The default installation prefix is =~/Library/Script Libraries=
  because this was the only location that allowed the scripts to
  reference eachother without messing with paths or
  =OSA_LIBRARY_PATH=.

  - You must create this directory if it does not already exist.

- Simply =make all= to compile and install the scripts to the default
  =PREFIX= of =~/Library/Script Libraries=

  - This step does both compilation and installation, because the
    applescript compilation fails if a referenced script is not
    already installed to the load path. Applescript is a pain to work
    with.

  - If errors occur, if they are for a handler script for an
    application that you do not have installed, you can ignore them.
    Apple script compilation fails when scripts reference apps that
    aren't installed. Again, its a pain to work with.

- There are third party applications that will allow you to bind keys
  directly to these scripts. Alternatively, you can build and install
  the Automator workflows and create keybindings for these workflows
  in System Preferences:

  - =make services install-services=

  - Navigate to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services >
    General. There you will find the workflows =org-link= and
    =org-link-alt= and you can create keyboard shortcuts for them
    here.

  - You can now use your keyboard shortcuts or invoke the services
    from the services menu:

    [[file:services-menu.png]]

** Usage

There are two scripts that can be invoked, =org-link= and
=org-link-alt=. They both store org links to the current content, but
they can link to slightly different content. Currently, they are
identical for all applications except Preview. =org-link-alt= will
store a link to the "next" page in Preview. This is because, when in
two page mode, the "current page" is always the left page, so both
scripts are necessary to allow linking to either page.

*** Currently supported applications

|               | org-link           | org-link-alt    |
|---------------+--------------------+-----------------|
| Safari        | Link: URL          | same            |
| Firefox       | Link: URL          | same            |
| Google Chrome | Link: URL          | same            |
| Mail          | Link: message      | same            |
| Address Book  | Link: person       | same            |
| Skim          | Link: page         | same            |
| Preview       | Link: page         | Link: next page |
| BibDesk       | Link: entry        | same            |
| Pages         | Link: page [fn:3]  | same            |
| Numbers       | Link: range [fn:4] | same            |
| Keynote       | Link: slide        | same            |
| iTunes        | Link: track        | same            |
| Finder        | Link: file         | same            |
| Terminal      | Link: Terminal.app | same            |


- Unsupported applications that are AppleScript aware will attempt to
  create links to the front document

[fn:3] Pages actually links to a character offset from the start of
the document. If the document is edited, then the link may degrade.

[fn:4] Numbers opens and selects the linked range, but it may be necessary to
change sheet manually.      

** Uninstall

=make uninstall= and =make uninstall-services=

** Context

I created this fork of org-mac-protocol because org-mac-protocol has
not been updated for 10 years and its link format seemed to no longer
be supported by Org. This fork also automates more of the installation
process, adds the option to install Automator workflows, and
reorganized the applescripts so that they can actually compile and
don't pester the user with "where is this application located"
messages when any supported applications aren't installed.

Features such as =org-note= and =org-remember= were stripped, not
because they are bad but because I didn't feel like reimplementing
them and don't plan to use them myself.
